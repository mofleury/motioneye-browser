What motioneye-browser is
--
A (very) simple browser webapp that lets you see what images and videos were recorded by motioneye remotely.

Designed to use a very limited set of dependencies, so that it can be deployed on a raspberry Pi easily.

Dependencies
--
- python
- apache web server, with CGI enabled
- imagemagick, to create thumbnails
